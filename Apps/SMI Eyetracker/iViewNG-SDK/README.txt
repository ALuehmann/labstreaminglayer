== Driver Installation ==

Before you can use this app, you need to obtain the iViewNG SDK from www.smivision.com (note that this program requires the "iViewNG SDK", not the older  "iView X SDK"; there is a different app for the new SDK). At the time of this writing, the download page is: http://www.smivision.com/en/gaze-and-eye-tracking-systems/support/software-download.html (alternatively you might try to google for iViewNG SDK). Please make sure that your eye tracking model is supported by the SDK. Note the installation location and after you have installed the drivers, copy the contents of the bin/bin-Windows7-32, include/ and lib/lib-Windows7-32 folders into this folder. You should now be able to run the app!

== Usage ==

By default this app will start a lightweight server in the background, unless you explicitly specify the IP address of a machine that runs a server. In this mode no configuration should be necessary as long as your eye tracker is correctly installed (USB drivers, etc), which requires that you also install the regular tracking software. However, the downside is that you will not be able to calibrate your tracker as this program has no calibration GUI on its own (although the default calibration is okay for testing).

If you run an SMI tracking server locally, you can use the IP address 127.0.0.1 to connect to it. The benefit of using a separate tracking server is that it allows you to calibrate the eye tracker in its GUI and troubleshooting is much easier (if you run into issues you should always first confirm that your glasses work with the official tracking programs before contacting us). You can get the server program from SMI (one server is called iViewETG for the eye tracking glasses). 

By default this program will only stream gaze coordinates. If you also would like access to the raw scene camera image, you need to set a Scene Camera Resolution (optionally you can also switch between 1-channel grayscale and 3-channel RGB color in the Scene Camera Color Space setting). This stream has a *very* high data rate -- if you connect over a 10/100 network link, you must reduce the resolution to a very low value, otherwise your program will start running behind. For the same reason you should not attempt to record this stream to disk, since your file size will be in the gigabytes before you know it. If the scene camera is enabled, a second LSL stream will be created. In addition to the scene camera, you can also record from one or both eye cameras by setting an Eye Camera Resolution (depending on the Eye Camera Side setting, this creates one or two streams). The same bandwidth considerations apply here, too. Lastly, if you want to record the scene video to disk (which is generally recommended for archival purposes), check the checkbox Compressed Scene Stream (the compression standard is H.264) and you will likely need some specialized or custom software to decode it later on.

As of this writing you can ignore the license key and device type settings. 

== Optional ==

The configuration settings can be saved to a .cfg file (see File / Save Configuration) and subsequently loaded from such a file (via File / Load Configuration). Importantly, the program can be started with a command-line argument of the form "iViewNG.exe -c myconfig.cfg", which allows to load the config automatically at start-up. The recommended procedure to use the app in production experiments is to make a shortcut on the experimenter's desktop which points to a previously saved configuration customized to the study being recorded to minimize the chance of operator error.
