=== For Developers ===

This information is only relevant if your are trying to build apps that are consistent with those that are already included in the distribution.
Essentially, you will need Visual Studio (2008 preferred) and a compatible version of the Qt SDK. If you are at SCCN, follow the installation 
instructions located in /home/software/DevEnvironment to set up a build environment that lets you develop modules for LSL (and their GUIs) painlessly.

The material is also available to external developers through ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/third_party/build_environment/
